# React Router v7 + Shopify + Cloudflare

RRv7 boilerplate for Shopify apps using Cloudflare's Workers, KV and Durable Objects.

Please do not blindly use this for production apps. No security guarantees. This repo serves just as inspiration for building Shopify apps with React Router v7 and Cloudflare Workers.

Uses React Router's Middleware, which is still experimental.

Inspired by [Shopflare](https://github.com/chr33s/shopflare) and [React Router v7 Cloudflare Template](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router-templates/tree/main/cloudflare)
